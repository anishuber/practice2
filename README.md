# **Music Library Management** ðŸŽµ

### **Description**

Create a system to manage a music library. The system should keep track of **artists**, their **albums**, and **songs**.

### **Main Classes**

1. **`Artist`**
    - **Properties:**
        - `string Name` â€” the name of the artist.
        - `string Genre` â€” the music genre.
        - `List<Album> Albums` â€” a list of albums (composition).
    - **Method:**
        - `void AddAlbum(Album album)` â€” add an album to the artist.

2. **`Album`**
    - **Properties:**
        - `string Title` â€” the title of the album.
        - `DateTime ReleaseDate` â€” the release date.
        - `List<Song> Songs` â€” a list of songs (composition).
    - **Method:**
        - `void AddSong(Song song)` â€” add a song to the album.

3. **`Song`**
    - **Properties:**
        - `string Title` â€” the title of the song.
        - `TimeSpan Duration` â€” the duration of the song.
        - `Artist Performer` â€” the artist who performs the song (aggregation).

### **Examples**

1. Create several artists and albums.
2. Add songs to albums.
3. Display all albums for a specific artist.
4. Calculate the total number of songs and the total duration of all albums.
5. Find the longest song by an artist.

### **Why Does This Task Demonstrate Composition and Aggregation Well?**

- **Composition:** An album cannot exist without songs, and an artist cannot exist without albums.
- **Aggregation:** A song can exist independently of an album because it references an artist (`Performer`) but is not directly part of the album.
